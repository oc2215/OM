### OMIL CARRASQUILLO 

My professional background includes instruction in reading with diverse populations, including bilingual and dual language, elementary (K-5), staff facilitator, and workshops for staff and parents. 

In each of the experiences above, the focus has included, vocabulary development, literacy skills, critical reading, and code switching for text comprehension (bilingual students). The goal, across content areas, was to develop higher level skills by teaching the student to become familiarized with the text (text features & author), summarizing the context, reacting to the text, etc.
